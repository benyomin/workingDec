\end{itemize}

US granted refugee status to J. from FSU until 1989 - what about exit visa from Soviet Union?

after 1989 - family reunification visa to USA, but didn't other article say this was earlier?

skilled immigrants go to countries with high returns to skills, low-skilled  (less skilled) prefer social safety net countries

compare rate of earnings growth for FSU immigrants v. US natives and IL natives of similar demographics
