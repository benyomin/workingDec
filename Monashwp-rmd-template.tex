\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\subsection{The housing market}\label{the-housing-market}

The study of housing provides a fascinating topic for the researcher of
Israeli society. Several factors have drawn attention to the housing
market and made it a topic of much discussion. The price of housing was
one of the main issues that drove more than 400,000 demonstrators to the
streets in the summer of 2011. Large portions of the Israeli population
own a home, or rent one, or live in a multi-family household. Their
first-hand experience of the market may be relayed to the researcher as
anecdotal evidence of the state of the housing market, as well as causes
and solutions for the perceived short-comings of the market.

In a simple economic model of the housing market, house prices are set
by the market forces of supply and demand. Various influences on
suppliers of housing (current owners who choose to sell, builders of new
housing), and those who demand housing (commonly characterized as young
couples) will shift the supply and demand curves and affect the
market-clearing price level. Consider an interest-rate reduction, this
shifts the demand curve to the right, as cheaper credit causes more
buyers to enter the market. It also reduces credit-constraints on
builders and leads to increased supply, albeit after some lag.

The average house price has risen by an astonishing 80\% between the
2008 global financial crisis and 2016. In the minds of many lay
observers this indicates a lack of supply, with main bottlenecks
limiting supply being cited as the sale of government land or the
lengthy permitting process for new construction.

Gruber(citation) however offers copious evidence and cogent reasoning to
support his claim that the chief factor in the rise was actually
excessive demand. As global capital markets suffered large declines
investors moved to other asset classes, including the real estate
market. The additional factor of low interest rates lead to a dramatic
increase in purchase of additional houses by those who were already
owner-occupiers. This shifted the demand curve to the right, increasing
the average cost of an apartment and driving out less affluent
first-time homebuyers. These would-be first-time homebuyers then entered
or remained in the rental market, driving up average rents. The higher
market rental prices and lowered vacancy rate established a feedback
loop which further encouraged in the purchase of investment houses as
rental property. \#\# Consumption by Households The expenditure method
for calculating National Income (Y), states that Y=GDP=C+I+G+NX. The
gross domestic product is equal to Consumption Expenditure (C) plus
Investment Expenditure (I) plus Government Expenditure (G) plus Net
Exports (NX). Firms and households each engage in both consumption and
investment. When a firm buys a copy machine which lasts several years,
that is an investment, so is the purchase of owner-occupied housing, in
fact it's one of the chief investments made by households. The paper
placed in the copy machine and the food on the table are each classified
as consumption. Consumption by households makes up a large and important
part of GDP. It is a measure tracked closely by businesses, economists
and the government. You may have heard the nightly news announce the
latest retail-sales data. Household income is either saved or consumed,
with the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and the marginal
propensity to save (MPS) summing to 1. Generally household consumption
can be understood as household income times the MPC. The MPC can be
affected by the interest rate, rising interest rates incentivize
additional savings, raising the MPS and lowering the MPC. Falling
interest rates decrease the attraction of savings. With a constant MPC a
household can increase consumption due to increased income from a salary
increase, hourly wage increase or increase in the number of hours
worked. Household consumption would fall due a decrease in salary, wages
or working hours. A further factor in consumption is expected future
income. This posits that the rational consumer increases their
consumption now if they know that they will get a raise or some overtime
next week. They will also reduce consumption and increase savings now
when they expect future unemployment or wage reductions. Another factor
affecting consumption is the wealth effect. When the wealth of a
household increases (the price of shares held in an investment
portfolio, the price of Picasso on the wall or in a vault, the price of
the family home or rental property), household consumption increases, in
effect spending now some of the expected future gains on the sale of the
shares, painting or real estate. Conversely, a decline in household
wealth should produce a decline in household consumption and GDP. \#\#
the wealth effect, or wealth effects? This study combines household
level consumption data with housing price data to estimate test the
hypothesis that different age cohorts have different wealth effects. It
has been postulated that older households will have a higher wealth
effect, or larger proportional change in spending in response to a
change in wealth than a younger household. The available consumption
data from the Household Expenditure Survey provides us with a means to
test this hypothesis.
